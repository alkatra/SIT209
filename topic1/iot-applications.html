    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    <h2>Activity 1</h2>
    <p>An IoT Application allows devices to talk to each other to facilitate certain features either digitally or physically without the aid of a person.
  </br>Some examples that come to mind are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Home/Alexa etc smart speakers</li>
        <li>Philips Hue bulbs</li>
        <li>Remote Central Climate Controls based on sensors</li>
        <li>Smart Watches</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Activity 2 and 3</h2>
    <p>In a smart building, ideally there would be an app that regulates user functions as per their demand. Temperature of common areas would be regulated by the building manager and each apartment would have its own NFC key via the app as well as climate controls. A myriad of sensors will be needed for proper functioning, including sensors to detect light and day, motion sensors to detect body movement to enable lighting and climate controls, fire detectors, smoke detectors, and various safety systems as well as energy-efficiency promoting sensors. A processing room is needed for all smart communications as well as servers for the application to communicate with the devices. With a local server, latency is reduced and bandwidth is increased with proper connections to devices via hidden ethernet wires. One other useful feature might be the integration of speakers over each area of the apartments with a smart device controlling each of them via voice/mobile commands.</p>
    <p>An IoT control interface for the smart building would have to include a dashboard featuring current energy efficiency levels, compared with historical data over the past weeks/months. Toggleable notifications should alert residents of outside temperatures and whether their climate control setting is the most efficient for the moment. It should be compatible with various IoT devices and their functionalities such as changing the color of Philips Hue bulbs, adjusting volumes of Alexa/Google Home etc smart home devices, etc. It should have an authentication method such as biometrics as the app could possibly act as an NFC key to the apartment itself. A chat platform with a ticket system should be issued between residents, the landlords, and the building manager.</p>
    <p>The parts needed to make it work might fall into the following list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processing Unit</li>
      <li>Various environmental sensors</li>
      <li>Various energy sensors</li>
      <li>Memory</li>
      <li>Central Control Unit</li>
    </ul>
